# Tasteful Reddit

Please bare in mind that this project is a work in progress and one of the more intermediate/advanced things I've been working on. It aims to make a central hub for different Reddit baking and cooking recipes. The key components work in terms of pulling data from the Reddit JSON on different subreddits. Right now, I'm working on how best to iterate through an object that's already mapped out and linked to a different subreddit. This should be completed soon, and once it is there will be a live version.

I'm also working out some small issues with code formatting.

## Technologies Used

I've used JSON, React, Redux for storing the state, Axios for making the API call, React Router DOM and Boostrap.
